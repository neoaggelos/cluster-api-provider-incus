                                            - `ubuntu:VERSION` => `ubuntu/VERSION/cloud` from https://images.linuxcontainers.org
                                            - `debian:VERSION` => `debian/VERSION/cloud` from https://images.linuxcontainers.org
                                            - `images:IMAGE` => `IMAGE` from https://images.linuxcontainers.org
                                            - `capi:IMAGE` => `IMAGE` from https://d14dnvi2l3tc5t.cloudfront.net
                                            - `capi-stg:IMAGE` => `IMAGE` from https://djapqxqu5n2qu.cloudfront.net

                                          For LXD:

                                            - `ubuntu:VERSION` => `VERSION` from https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases
                                            - `debian:VERSION` => `debian/VERSION/cloud` from https://images.lxd.canonical.com
                                            - `images:IMAGE` => `IMAGE` from https://images.lxd.canonical.com
                                            - `capi:IMAGE` => `IMAGE` from https://d14dnvi2l3tc5t.cloudfront.net
                                            - `capi-stg:IMAGE` => `IMAGE` from https://djapqxqu5n2qu.cloudfront.net

                                          Any instances of `VERSION` in the image name will be replaced with the machine version.
                                          For example, to use debian based kubeadm images, you can set image name to "capi:kubeadm/VERSION/debian"

                                      infrastructure is a production cluster.

                                      Can be one of:

                                        - `name`: where `name` is the name of a cluster member.
                                        - `@name`: where `name` is the name of a cluster group.

                                      Target is ignored when infrastructure is single-node (e.g. for
                                      development purposes).

                              OVN will create a network load balancer.

                              The controller will automatically update the list of backends for the network load balancer as control plane nodes are added or removed from the cluster.

                              The cluster administrator is responsible to ensure that the OVN network is configured properly and that the LXCMachineTemplate objects have appropriate profiles to use the OVN network.

                              When using the "ovn" mode, the load balancer address must be set in `.spec.controlPlaneEndpoint.host` on the LXCCluster object.

                          In this case, the cluster administrator is responsible to create the
                          profile manually and set the `.spec.template.spec.profiles` field of all
                          LXCMachineTemplate objects.
