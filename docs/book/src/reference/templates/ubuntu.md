# Ubuntu cluster template

The ubuntu cluster template is the same as the [development](./development.md) cluster template, but works with an upstream Ubuntu 24.04 instance and installs kubeadm during cloud-init.

> **WARNING**: The load balancer container is a single point of failure for the control plane of the workload cluster, therefore should only be used for development or evaluation purposes.

> **WARNING**: cloud-init will download all binaries on all nodes while deploying the cluster. This is wasteful and will take longer than using a base image.
